## Overview

### The challenge
This challenge was about creating the product card with different layouts and images for the mobile and desktop versions.

## My process
I started this challenge as I do most of my frontend design now, with the html structure first, thinking about how I want to group the elements and wrapping the grouped elements in divs. Next I go on to style using css. First thing I work on is positioning of the elements, before moving on to color, font-styling and decorative styling.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the process of completing this challenge, I learned how to center elements using a flex container. I also learned about using css reset styles to remove browser default styles. I also, for the first time, used a browser extension called perfect pixel to make my final design as close to the original design as possible.


### Continued development

I intend to practice more with the perfect pixel extension. It is a very useful tool for getting the design very close to the mockup. I had issues using it to design the mobile design version.

### Useful resources

- [Css style reset code](https://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - This helped me with the css to reset browser default styles
